# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Intelligent Auto Punisher:
# Automatically runs punishment commands on players who excessively trigger modules within a defined time frame.
# Ops or players with "chatsentry.autopunisher.exempt" will be exempt to ONLY automatic warnings.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Under punishment nodes you can:
# Use the format "{player_msg}: message" to send a message to the player.
# Use the format "{console_cmd}: command" to run a command as the console.
# Use the format "{player_cmd}: command" to run a command as the player.
# Use the format "{broadcast}: message" to broadcast a message to all players.

# With network mode enabled in config.yml, you can:
# Use the format "{proxy_console_cmd}: command" to run a command as the from the proxy
# Use the format "{proxy_player_cmd}: command" to run a command as the player from the proxy

# Within the above formats, you can use:
# "{PLAYER}" - players username for commands.
# "{PLAYER_DISPLAYNAME}" - players display name with its original colors
# "{PLAYER_DISPLAYNAME_STRIPPED}" - players display name stripped of its original colors
# "{CURRENT_WARNS}" - players current warning count for the target module.
# "{MAX_WARNS}" - maximum warning count for the target module.

# enabled: true/false nodes determine whether a warning will be added to the player who triggered the module.

# Note: You need a plugin to handle the punishment commands for muting, banning, etc. Essentials, AdvancedBan, or LiteBans recommended for punishment commands.

# In hours, how often should one warning (on every module) expire from players?
# Set this to -1 to never have warnings expire automatically. This will disable the option below this option as well.
warning-lifetime: 12

# In hours, how often (after startup) should the warnings file be scanned for expired warnings? Keep this at 1 unless you experience tick lag from ChatSentry.
# Note that the file is also checked on every server startup.
check-expiry-interval: 12

# Should the Auto Punisher send a message to the console when it warns a player, auto expires a players warning, or runs punishment actions on a player?
verbose-from-console: true

# When enabled, pardon messages will be hidden from receiver players only if triggered by the console. The point of this is so players don't see when their warnings are reset when triggered by the last punishment set under a module.
suppress-pardons-from-console: true

# Should a broadcast be sent to everybody when a player is manually warned via /warn? (broadcast is configurable via the misc-lang.yml file)
broadcast-manual-warnings: true

# Currently the only modules that support warnings are:
# Chat Cooldown, Link & Ad Blocker, Word & Phrase Filter, Chat Executor, Unicode remover, Cap limiter, Anti Parrot, Anti chat flood, and Anti Statue Spambot

# Manual = warnings that are applied manually via /cswarn <player>

# Players module warnings can be manually cleared with "/cswarnings clearmodulewarnings <player> <module name>"
# Players admin-given (manual) warnings can be cleared with "/cswarnings pardonallmanual <player>"



# IMPORTANT: The applicable above pardon command should be ran at the end (highest) warning count to reset the players warning count immediately to prevent them getting warning counts higher than the max punishment, allowing them to get infinite warnings without punishment.
